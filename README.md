# Block Tech - Frontend Assessment

In this assessment we'll try to make a presentation page for Cats.

For this purpose we'll use the [Cat API](https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/images/images-search), a cool API for - you guessed it - cats.

# List of cats

## JSX / CSS

- Show a cat - get creative! [`flex`, `html`, `css`]
  - Use any UI library you know of, or implement this with plain CSS [`material-ui`]
