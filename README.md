# Block Tech - Frontend Assessment

In this assessment we'll try to make a presentation page for Cats.

For this purpose we'll use the [Cat API](https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/images/images-search), a cool API for - you guessed it - cats.

# catApp

## JSX, CSS, APIs

### Challenges
- Create UI component to show a list of cats
  - You can get a list of Cats using [this](https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/images/images-search) call. [`useEffect`, `fetch`, `state management`]
  - Show 10 cats

- Create a UI component that shows up when user clicks on a cat - get creative! [`flex`, `html`, `css`]
  - Use any UI library you know of, or implement this with plain CSS [`material-ui`, `tachyons`]

- Create a UI component that implements additional functionality for a cat
  - Save the cat in favourites (Steps: read the docs, implement UI, add button and event listeners)

- How would you implement pagination
  - next page
  - previous page
  - last page
  - state management

# Discussion/Questions
- How would you rate the code quality? What can be improved?
- Where can we refactor things with reusability in mind?
- Does it work?
